I like Hype because it gives creators an easier and more efficient way to connect and build their portfolio. As someone who worked in the photography and events industry before, I know how hard it can be to find models, designers, and other creatives for specific projects.
I'm excited to use AWS and other technologies we talked about as a group. We haven't decided the legal part yet but we talked about a LLC. I like the idea of fremium platforms and services.
