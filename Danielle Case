Deise, Jose, and I came up with this idea together. I think it is a really great idea that can easily be expanded to allow for enough work for the three of us throughout the semester. It is a project that I am passionate about because I am a creative person and would love a simple way to collaborate with others. I like the idea of also being able to have a place to host a portfolio and have a place to share project.s
I think this could also become a good business by having ads on the page and also perhaps charging a fee when people have connected (like an Air bnb fee). Technically this project has a lot of backend to work on and it can easily be scaled to fit the project specifications for this semester.
