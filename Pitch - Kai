I think this is a really cool idea and would love to work on it! I have roommates who are in the ad program at BYU and they always talk about how difficult it would be to 
find different models! It would be awesome to work on this! I think i could help contribute by getting the right data from different sources
as i said before, i have access to a lot of photographers and also videographers that would need models too so i could help figure out what the
most important aspects would be! I could also help with the business side and help price out the subscription base. It would be cool to work on a
LLC and AWS would be great for relational database.
