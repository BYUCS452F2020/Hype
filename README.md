# Hype
We are making an app that connects photogrphers with models. Instagram is too much of a mess and going through personal portfolios takes too long. Hype helps both members find their perfect creative match and get tot work immediately.
I am looking for a team of 3.
We want to use Firestore document-based database for the NoSQL portion of the project.

Business: Being a subscription-based service, income would come monthly for a small charge per member.
Legal: We wuld be an LLC.
Technical: We plan to use Amazon AWS for the relational database.
